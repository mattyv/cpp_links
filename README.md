[Top-Down performance analysis methodology](https://easyperf.net/blog/2019/02/09/Top-Down-performance-analysis-methodology) - Formal methodology (TMAM) for identifying performance bottlenecks using Intel's performance monitoring tools. Two-step iterative process: identify problem type (Frontend/Backend Bound, Bad Speculation, Retiring), then locate exact code location using PEBS.

[Swar Library](https://programming.sirrida.de/swar.html) - Comprehensive C++ template library for SIMD/SWAR (SIMD Within A Register) operations. Provides classes for bit operations, parallel arithmetic, shifts, rotations, shuffles, and compress/expand operations on integers from 8 to 128 bits.

[Bit Twiddling Hacks](https://graphics.stanford.edu/~seander/bithacks.html) - Collection of public domain bit manipulation techniques covering sign computation, bit counting, parity, swapping, bit reversal, modulus division, logarithms, trailing zeros, power of 2 rounding, and bit interleaving. Includes operation counts and performance notes.
